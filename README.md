# MachineLearning-using-R

This repository contains various experiments on Machine learning algorithms. 
The aim of this repo is to provide a better insight into various classification and clustering algorithms and how to practically play with some datasets using R-Programming as a tool.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to an experiment. Each experiment is containing a detail readme file and also all the scripts are written with enough comments for better understandability.
